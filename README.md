# Hi there, I am Yuriko Takamiya 👋
🌱 I used to work at an advertising agency as a creative director and decided to make my career change into developer.

🔭 I am currently enrolled in BloomTech's Full Stack Web Developer course. I am looking to a Full Stack Developer or Software Developer position to utilize my strong technical and programming skills. 

💬 Ask me anything about my recent projects such as Anywhere Fitness and Crypto World!

⚡ Fun fact:　I was a 400m sprinter when I was in high school track and field club. I have gotten a first prize and participated in national conpetition🏃🏻‍♀️

...and I love CATS🐱
